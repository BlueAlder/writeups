## Enum

##### Nmap

`sudo nmap -A jack.thm -oN jack `

`nmap` tells us we have a host running ssh and serving a wordpress application.

##### WPScan

`wpscan --url jack.thm`

>XML-RPC seems to be enabled

We can use this to enumerate usernames. Let's try:
* `http://jack.thm/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1` - 200 - we are able to see the *jack* user (that we already know about)
* `http://jack.thm/wp-json/wp/v2/users/2` - 401 - not allowed to view this user
* `http://jack.thm/wp-json/wp/v2/users/99` - 404 - user not found

WPScan to the rescue as it provides user enumerition AND bruteforcing which may allow us into the `wp-admin` panel. We find 2 additional users.

`wpscan --wpscan --url jack.thm --enumerate u`

Put all three users into a users.txt file and use a wordlist of your choice to brute force. We are able to sucesfully obtain a password for a user. Use that to login to `wp-admin`. 

`wpscan --url jack.thm --passwords rockyou.txt --usernames users.txt`

Unfortunately, once logged in, the user does not have any administrative rights. Time to move onto exploitation.

## Exploit


### User

* https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44595
* edit plugin php
* insert php reverse shell
* gain access to `www-data` user shell
* obtain user flag

## Priv Esc

Our next aim is to move from `www-data` to `jack`. Fortunately, according to `reminder.txt` in jack's home directory, this user has an issue setting permissions on backups. Doing a quick check we find `/var/backups` that contains some goodies that `www-data` is able to read. Using this, we can SSH to the host. 

`find / -name backup* 2>/dev/null`

## Root

* linPEAS (or any other privesc script of choice)
* nothing of interest can be found apart from various interesting file access rights.
* hint reveals that python is being used.
* use `pspy` to monitor for any strange cronjobs by root
* ðŸ‘€
    * `2020/08/30 00:26:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=3036   | /usr/bin/python /opt/statuscheck/checker.py `
##### python exploitation

`checker.py`:

```python
import os

os.system("/usr/bin/curl -s -I http://127.0.0.1 >> /opt/statuscheck/output.log")
```

From previous linenum scripts `jack` is a part of `family` which has write access to /usr/lib/python2.7/

Since we know `os.system` is being used in the script we have a lot of options to gain root access such as:

* modify `os.py` to facilitate a reverse shell.
* change permissions of other files and folders within the system (as root).
* change ssh configs to allow for password-less root access via ssh.
* obtain the root flag and write it to a file that is world readable.
